#### Game Tutorial
- Move Right Move Left is a game that's a little bit different.
- There are two paddles, each controlled independently. The upper paddle is controlled by the up and down arrow keys, and the lower paddle is controlled by the left and right arrow keys.
- Your goal is to use the paddles to control the ball. In each level, you'll need to hit the right wall with the ball, and then the left wall. You'll then move onto the next level and things will get harder.
- Before each level, you'll need to resize your browser's window to change the game's size. This can make the game a lot harder.
- Try to get as far as you can with three lives. It may start easy, but just you wait. Good luck.
